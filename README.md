## Phase 1: Planning
The first step is to search around and find at least two sources of inspiration. You might find the tone of the content interesting, or you think it's a well organized layout, or you might just like the color or font choices. We're not going to rip off the design, of course, but it helps to find things we like in order to emulate them. Post your links to your Slack group and explain why it's inspired you.

The next step is to figure out your content, the whole purpose of your site. Read this guide to website structure and simple planning on MDN and go through the exercise at the bottom. This article teaches you a few more HTML elements that we haven't talked about yet. They'll be handy for this site build and we'll work more with them later. The exercise called "Planning a simple website" introduces the idea of Information Architecture, the process of organizing content for a good user experience.

To plan your portfolio, follow this exercise and complete the five steps on paper. Take a photo and post them in a thread on your Slack group. Think of this as a rough draft. Here are some things you should think about:

What content do you want on your portfolio? (e.g. About page? Resume? Contact Info? Projects? Blog? Recent Social Media Posts?)
How many different types of pages will you need for that content? (e.g. Will your project pages have a different layout than your homepage?)
How will you create the content? (e.g. Is it all text or do you have some images? How will you show your projects?)
Do you own all of your content? (e.g. Don't steal content. Here is a nice description of some common software licenses that you might find on Github.)

### Requirements
It must be a multi-page site.
You should plan at least 2 different page layouts.
There must be consistent elements across all pages, like a header or navigation.
The content should be high quality and personalized.

## Phase 2: Setup
Follow this article to set up your repository. It's incredibly important that you follow their directions or else your project will not be deployed properly!

### Requirements
Each page should have all of its content prepared.
The content should reflect the purpose of the site, defined in the previous phase.
It should be written in plain text or very simple Markdown, no HTML.
You need to commit the content to the GitHub repository and organize it according to your plan.

### Phase 2.5: Marking Up Content
Not really a separate step, but let's dive into HTML. Just HTML. Be semantic, describe your content's purpose just like our first week with HTML. Don't think about how to style anything at all yet. Non-semantic tags like div and span can be sprinkled in later if we need them, but right now they don't mean a thing.

## Phase 3
You can work on simple sketches and provide a list of colors you like. Or you can find a tool to build a more complete mock-up. The choice is yours.

What is most important, though, is that you start thinking about how to employ a design to communicate your content in the best way possible. You might want to explore some principles of good design so that you have some good rules to follow.

### Requirements
For each of your layouts, create a higher fidelity design to work off of.
Don't forget responsiveness! You should show how content might react at different screen sizes.
You should have a good idea of your color palette.
