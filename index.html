<p> Project section introduction w/ link to github

h1 DOM ADVENTURE GAME

<p> This is what the final result of my "DOM Adventure" Looks like. One of the more challenging projects so far. 

h1 HTML/CSS RESUME

<p> This is my resume page which was our first major HTML/CSS project. 

h1 TIC-TAC-TOE

<p> Tic-Tac-Toe was our first major group project. Creating something this simple was suprisingly very tough.

h1 LEARNGITBRANCHING

<p> This wasnt a project, but definetly an accomplishment to be proud of. Git is really confusing to learn and use.
