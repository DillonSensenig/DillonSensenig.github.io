DOM ADVENTURE GAME

This is what the final result of my "DOM Adventure" Looks like. One of the more challenging projects so far. 

HTML/CSS RESUME

This is my resume page which was our first major HTML/CSS project. 

TIC-TAC-TOE

Tic-Tac-Toe was our first major group project. Creating something this simple was suprisingly very tough.

LEARNGITBRANCHING

This wasnt a project, but definetly an accomplishment to be proud of. Git is really confusing to learn and use.
